# VR-Instincts
An open source alternative to VRTK that aims to make VR instinctively easy for both the coder and user

# Downloading
When you clone the git you will need to import [the SteamVR plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647?aid=1011l8xVZ) from the asset store.

# Support
We have a [discord here](https://discord.gg/mycPJDu)
There are tutorials on how most of the code works on [wirewhiz.com](https://wirewhiz.com)
technically wirewhiz has a reddit, [join if you dare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WireWhizVR/) I'll try to update it more if people are interested.

# Help me out
I am very open to getting others working on this with me, my end goal isn't just a downloads page for my website. It's to have the best VR plugin out there. So if you want to contribute just tell me.
I'm still working out how I'm going to do it but I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WireWhiz) if you want to support me in doing this.
