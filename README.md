# VR-Instincts
An open source alternative to VRTK that aims to make VR instinctively easy for both the coder and user

# *THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED* 
This was never finised, and is no longer being maintained. Hower, at the time of this edit I am employed by SpatialApe developing Foundry, which if you are interested in this, you will definitly want to check out. </br>

### Downloading
You can find the [latest release here](https://github.com/WireWhiz/VR-Instincts/releases).
When you download the .unitypackage or clone the git you will need to import [the SteamVR plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamvr-plugin-32647?aid=1011l8xVZ) from the asset store to get it to work.

### Support
We have a [discord here](https://discord.gg/mycPJDu)

There are tutorials on how most of the code works on [wirewhiz.com](https://wirewhiz.com)

Technically wirewhiz has a reddit, [join if you dare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WireWhizVR/) I'll try to update it more if people are interested.

### Help me out
I am very open to getting others working on this with me, my end goal isn't just a downloads page for my website. It's to have the best VR plugin out there. So if you want to contribute just tell me.

I'm still working out how I'm going to do it but I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WireWhiz) if you want to support me in doing this.
